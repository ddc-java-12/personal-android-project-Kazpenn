## Summary

Topic 1

This app's purpose is to help people who don't like to look for new games. It has you input games
that you have enjoyed and games you didn't enjoy, so it can find games to recommend and games to 
avoid. There is also user based comments so that you can see what other people have played and what 
they thought of the game.

Topic 2

Ever wanted to play Blackjack at anytime, of course you have, everyone's a gambler! We made it so 
that you can play Blackjack at anytime, revolutionary I know. This one in a million app lets you 
feel the lows and highs off your favorite money waster, without wasting any money!

## Intended users

Topic 1

* People who like to play games but think it's a hassle trying to find new games to play.
> As a broke college student who likes to play games but thinks that going to a Gamestop or browsing 
> Steam without a clear objective is annoying. I want an app that will give me recommendations based on the games 
> I've enjoyed, not just bought.
 
* People who want to introduce people to new games they enjoy.
> As a gamer who picks up every new release, I like to give people a warning on games to avoid and 
> which games to pick up. Reviews might make people buy a game that they just don't like because 
> they heard it got a good rating, I want an app that avoids that issue.

* People who just enjoy Blackjack
> As one of the top Blackjack players in my state, I think it's pretty obvious that I like the game,

## Functionality

Topic 1

* Never unhappy

The goal of playing games is enjoyment, whether that enjoyment comes from brutal difficulty, a wide 
range of customization options, or a relaxing gameplay loop, people play games for different 
reasons. Some people tend to buy quite a few games, whether it be because of a sale, or they had a 
recommendation from a friend who likes different games, or any number of reasons, sometimes people 
end up with games they don't like. The goal is to create an app that will never leave users 
disappointed with purchases again.

* Sharing tastes

People inherently like to talk about stuff they enjoy, it's in our nature, we want to promote that. 
By having users submit what game they liked as well as what games they didn't enjoy we can filter 
the app so that someone who didn't enjoy GTA V, never sees a review from someone who did enjoy it. 
We want people to find games they are more than likely going to enjoy, so we can reduce the amount 
of games that will sit on someone's shelf, or in someone's steam library that will never be played.

// I honestly have no idea how to revise these, or at least make them different. I do see how they 
are basically the same thing.

Topic 2

* Play whenever you want

You have to go to a casino if you want to bet money, unfortunately, our app doesn't change that(yet)
, however it does change were and when you can play Blackjack, on your way to work? Why not take out
your phone and get a little rush from trying to win some chips. On a really boring date? some 
gambling should help ease your empty wallet. It's the ultimate convince, play wherever you want, 
whenever you want!

* Avoid losing money.

As of writing this our app has 0 in-app purchases, meaning no matter how much you might want to buy
more chips after losing them all, you can't. Don't worry, you can't go below 1 chip, so you can
always have a chance to climb back up and win big. Any normal casino would kick you out after you 
lose everything, not us, we pride ourselves on always letting our users come back to some amount of
chips, never 0.

//I'm not really sure how to fix this, not only because it's a rather one note idea with not a lot of 
depth, but also because it relies on community feedback, which Nick said was out of the question.
It might be too late, but I would like to change this topic to Video Blackjack, I enjoy Blackjack 
quite a bit and creating my own Blackjack app sounds fun. If I am unable to change I understand and
seeing as it's 11pm as I'm writing this I doubt you'll see this till tomorrow morning.

//post writing the Topic 2 revisions, I hope you will let me switch this, I know its last minute, but
I'm much more confident in this idea. After some reflection I realized more online stores 
(specifically Steam) already has this feature more or less.
