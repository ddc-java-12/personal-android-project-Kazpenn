## Summary

This app's purpose is to help people who don't like to look for new games. It has you input games that you have enjoyed and games you didn't enjoy so it can find games to recommend and games to avoid. There is also user based comments so that you can see what other people have played and what they thought of the game.

## Intended users

* People who like to play games but think it's a hassle trying to find new games to play.
>As someone who likes to play games but thinks that going to a Gamestop or browsing Steam without a clear objective is annoying. I want an app that will give me recommendations based on the games i've enjoyed, not just bought.
 
* People who want to introduce people to new games they enjoy.
> As a gamer who picks up every new release, I like to give people a warning on games to avoid and which games to pick up. Reviews might make people buy a game that they just don't like because they heard it got a good rating, I want an app that avoids that issue.

## Functionality

* Never unhappy

The goal of playing games is enjoyment, whether that enjoyment comes from brutal difficulty, a wide range of customization options, or a relaxing gameplay loop, people play games for different reasons. Some people tend to buy quite a few games, whether it be because of a sale, or they had a recommendation from a friend who likes different games, or any number of reasons, sometimes people end up with games they don't like. The goal is to create an app that will never leave users disappointed with purchases again.

* Sharing tastes

People inherently like to talk about stuff they enjoy, it's in our nature, we want to promote that. By having users submit what game they liked as well as what games they didn't enjoy we can filter the app so that someone who didn't enjoy GTA V, never sees a review from someone who did enjoy it. We want people to find games they are more than likely going to enjoy, so we can reduce the amount of games that will sit on someone's shelf, or in someone's steam library that will never be played.
